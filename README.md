### Hi there 👋

I'm Jan, a computer science master's student from Würzburg Germany.

My sweet spot is embedded development with a focus on space-related control software and computer vision.
During my studies, I got the opportunity to work on three REXUS/BEXUS projects.
We built an autonomous vision system on a high-altitude balloon and a novel recovery system [Daedalus](https://wuespace.de/daedalus/) which is dropped from sounding rockets.
This is an amazing journey and I am proud to present our open source ground station [Telestion](https://github.com/TelestionTeam) to you which powers these projects.

If you are lucky you will probably catch me fiddling with my passion: computer game projects.
To put some more effort into this hobby I started a double degree in games engineering. 
After half a year of work, I proudly present our first game prototype [Back in Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irkcqxGfY24&list=PLthd3ST3SckSovN5qMWRHe4go_FHJtczU&index=12) to you.
