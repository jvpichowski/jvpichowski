### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 1st year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Julius-Maximilians University of WÃ¼rzburg. I work at the [ML4Nets research group](https://www.caidas.uni-wuerzburg.de/ml4nets/) headed by prof. Ingo Scholtes. I am part of the COMFORT project which focuses on compression methods for robustness and transferability.
